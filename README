nschrooter and folks
--------------------

My experiments on an user-runnable namespace-based chroot-like thing

nschrooter can be used by root as a chroot-replacement,
or by an user (with a suitable host system that has user namespaces)
as an unprivileged chroot helper. It does rather little to contain
the resulting entity (even less than eg. systemd-nspawn), so 
just be aware.


nssu
----
nssu ("namespace su") is a su-replacement for use in an unprivileged
chroot. It doesnt change your real identity, but changes
your apparent user and group IDs using a new user namespace, so
you can "become" whoever you want in your unprivileged chroot.

Of course all the files owned by you will still be owned
by this user ID, etc, so it provides no filesystem isolation,
but the point is to make it possible to appear to be a non-root
user when building things (and "root" when installing) or
when just running stuff...

unsfilter
---------
unsfilter ("user ns filter") is a seccomp-based filter
that ignores chown and set*uid system calls, that would
basically always fail in an user ns. Can be helpful
for making stubborn things run :P

(oh, pidsearch is just a little thing I wrote to pgrep the
 host procfs ... was useful when testing things in crouton)
